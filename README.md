# Project Name:
## Diabetes Prediction

# Project Objective:
- To build a predictive model that accurately identifies the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on health-related attributes.

# Key Questions / KPIs Answered:

- Which features are most influential in predicting diabetes?
- What is the accuracy of the classification model?
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score of various models
- Confusion Matrix insights and ROC-AUC score

# Process Overview:

- Data preprocessing and handling missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends
- Feature selection and scaling
- Applied classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
- Evaluated model performance using key metrics

- Project Insights:

- Glucose level and BMI were the most significant predictors
- Random Forest outperformed other models in accuracy
- Balanced dataset using SMOTE improved model reliability
- Identified risk patterns that can support early intervention

# Project Description:
- Developed a machine learning model to predict diabetes using health metrics from the Pima Indian dataset. The project focused on model building, evaluation, and deriving actionable health insights through data exploration.
